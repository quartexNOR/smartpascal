<h1><strong>The Smart Mobile Studio Desktop</strong></h1>

<p>Also known as Amibian.js!</p>

<p>Written by Jon Lennart Aasenden, all rights reserved<br />

<h2><strong>Requirements</strong></h2>

<p>This application requires the NG (next generaton) edition of the Smart Mobile Studio runtime library.<br />
As of writing (04.03.2017) this version of the RTL is not yet released, but should be in the<br />
update &quot;alpha channel&quot; sometimes next week. A statement will be issued on www.smartmobilestudio.com<br />
and on our G+ and Facebook groups.</p>

<p>It has been compiled with an older version of Smart Mobile Studio, version 2.2.1.45.<br />
Which is the version I use when writing the RTL, basically because this ensures that the code<br />
must be backward compatible (that version uses CEF3 while the NG IDE uses CEF4).</p>

<h2><strong>About</strong></h2>

<p>The Smart Desktop is a quick and dirty implementation of the Amiga OS 4 Workbench.<br />
While appearance is one thing (which is easy under HTML), it does have some factors that requires<br />
a lot of coding to get right:</p>

<p>&nbsp;- Implements a filesystem class over LocalStorage and Sessionstorage<br />
&nbsp;- Ships with UAE.js that runs actual 68k Amiga software (!)<br />
&nbsp;- Ships with Webkit.js, which renders HTML offscreen and do complex compositing<br />
&nbsp;- Talks to the node.js backend server<br />
&nbsp;- Implements isolated focus handling (which is a bitch under HTML5)<br />
&nbsp;- Uses our layout library (a good demonstration) SmartCL.Layout.pas<br />
&nbsp;- Demonstrates out-of-view controls, the menu header is created outside the desktop view.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;All controls are created inside Application-&gt;Display-&gt;View, while the menu is<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;created directly in Application-&gt;Display. It is thus un-affected by scrolling and what<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;takes place inside the default view.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is work in progress! Right now you have some oddities, like when you double-click on<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ram-Disk you get the preferences window. But that will be fixed as we move along :)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The most important part was to get the general behavior in-place before the styling and<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; file-recognition is dealt with.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Traditionally the preferences application can be found under System:Prefs/Preferences[exe]</p>

<h2><strong>Uses</strong></h2>

<p>While initially created as a way to show-off some of the new features, the Smart Desktop has<br />
been instrumental in testing the next-generation RTL. If our RTL cannot be used to write<br />
complex software, then the product is worthless.<br />
The SMS desktop is about as complex as it gets. Wrapping full emulation systems like UAE,<br />
dealing with both normal and external windows (external being IFrames hosted at other domains).<br />
We also deal with global preferences, a local filesystem - not to mention direct contact with<br />
the node.js backend.</p>

<p>But the use doesnt end with testing. The desktop is being used as the foundation for Amibian, which<br />
is a popular Linux distro for ARM embedded boards. It is designed to emulate a real 1990&#39;s Amiga<br />
system. While the Smart Pascal side of things is important -- Ambian is equally important since this<br />
is ultimately a labour of love. We are huge Amiga fans and making a JS desktop in the shape of OS 4<br />
is both an ODE to the Amiga - and to libraries like CODEF, which is so inspiring to old hackers like<br />
ourselves.</p>

<p>A special thanks to Gunnar Kristjansson for testing, and also Thomas Navarro Garcia!<br />
Both of them work on the binary Amibian distro, and they also help me create the JS version of Amibian.<br />
Which I believe is one of the first meta-desktops running purely on JavaScript technology (node.js being the backend).</p>

<p>It is also used by &quot;Symbiotic elements&quot; as the foundation for their node.js based NAS systems.<br />
Where you log-in to your NAS through the browser to setup rules, work with files and do general<br />
management.</p>
 
<h2><strong>Legal uses</strong></h2>

<p>The desktop code will be updated here on GitHub on regular basis. It is important to note that<br />
<strong>YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DISTRIBUTE OR USE</strong> the code <u><span style="color:#e74c3c">unless you own</span></u> Smart Mobile Studio.<br />
For commercial work please contact the author, Jon L. Aasenden, for licensing.<br />
Non-commercial projects can use the code freely, as long as the origin is visually represented (for example in the about box).</p>

<h2><strong>Update frequency</strong></h2>

<p>Secondly, the GIT repository may not be the absolute bleeding edge.<br />
This first commit excludes the new server code which is in a separate folder. This is just lazyness on<br />
my part since I have a lot to do right now.<br />
I will join the projects later when we are not so busy getting the RTL in shape.</p>
